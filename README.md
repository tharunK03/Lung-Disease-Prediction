# Lung Disease Detection Web Application

This project is a web-based application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify lung diseases from chest X-ray images. The model identifies images into five categories: Bacterial Pneumonia, COVID-19, Normal, Tuberculosis, and Viral Pneumonia. The application is built with Flask for the backend and a simple, intuitive frontend for user interaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle: Lungs Disease Dataset (4 Types)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkarmanohardalvi/lungs-disease-dataset-4-types). It contains labeled chest X-ray images categorized into four types of lung diseases, which were expanded to five categories in this project by adding additional "Normal" images.

## Features

- **Image Upload and Preview**: Users can upload chest X-ray images and view a preview before processing.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: The app uses a trained CNN model to instantly predict the lung disease category.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and Flask, the interface is easy to navigate and provides immediate feedback.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LungDiseaseDetectionApp.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd LungDiseaseDetectionApp
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. **Access the application** at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.
3. **Upload an X-ray image**, preview it, and view the model’s prediction.

## Model Training

The CNN model was trained on the Kaggle dataset mentioned above. Data augmentation was applied to improve model robustness. The model is structured to classify images into five categories, helping in automated diagnosis.
